To update our version of TLF do the following:

NOTE ***The signed rsl, textLayout_1.0.0.buildnum.swz should not be put in svn.***

1. From the TLF build, unzip openSource\textLayout.zip to 
   ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\projects\textLayout.

2. Move projects\textLayout\samples to samples\textLayout.

3. Check to see if there were any changes to projects\textLayout\build.xml.  
   If so, they need to be moved by hand to our version of build.xml.  Do 
   not check in their build.xml.

4. Check to see if there are any new files or removed files and update svn 
   accordingly.

5. From ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\projects\textLayout run ant to make sure sources
   build.  This must be done before step 4 which will replace the swc you just
   built with the version from the TLF build.

6. From the TLF build, copy textLayout\libs\textLayout.swc to 
   ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\libs

7. From the TLF build, copy the unsigned rsl, 
   textLayout\rsl\textLayout_1.0.0.buildnum.swf to ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\rsls

8. Add this rsl to svn.  Delete the previous version of the rsl from svn.

9. Edit ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\flex-config.xml and update the buildnum to match 
   the swf from the step above.

    <runtime-shared-library-path>
        <path-element>libs/textLayout.swc</path-element>
        <rsl-url>textLayout_1.0.0.547.swf</rsl-url>     <== update build number
        <policy-file-url></policy-file-url>
    </runtime-shared-library-path>

10. Edit ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\air-config.xml and do the same edit.

11. Commit all the changes.
