# IMPORTANT NOTICE #

**THIS PROJECT IS NOT CURRENTLY ACTIVE AND HAS MISSING DEPENDENCIES. AT THE MOMENT, THERE ARE NO PLANS TO CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT ON TLFX.**

# Overview #
PLEASE READ NOTICE ABOVE!
Welcome to the Text Layout Framework Extended project. The TLFX library allows you to easily add HTML/CSS rendered content into your Flash applications. This compatibility layer is built on top of the Adobe sponsored open source Text Layout Framework (TLF) project. The intent is to fulfill the promise of HTML rendering while maintaining a cross platform browser experience that we've come to love using Flash.

# Why Extend TLF #
PLEASE READ NOTICE ABOVE!
First, why not ;)? The TLF project uses the MPL 1.1 license which guarantees that the code can be extended via third parties. Secondly, there have been many requests for the ability to utilize HTML support from within the framework. Given that the TLF team has focused on the TextFlow model, there was an ever present need to help provide extensions their HTML support. For instance, tables, lists and a number of other HTML related elements were not supported out of the TLF box. In addition, stylesheet support was light years behind the current CSS standards. This left the door open for a group to come in and continue developmental efforts on such areas.

We are aware that other teams have begun work on various areas of the TLF framework, and this is our first shot at opening up submissions to an extension of the core. Our goal is to help provide a library where developers across the board can commit and contribute to the extended framework. It is with these goals in mind that we feel the project can succeed. In addition, we have been in close contact with TLF team. They have applauded our efforts and our hope is that the two projects can benefit from one another.
